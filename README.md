# Smart-Grid-Stability
This dataset corresponds to an augmented version of the "Electrical Grid Stability Simulated Dataset", created by Vadim Arzamasov (Karlsruher Institut für Technologie, Karlsruhe, Germany) and donated to the University of California (UCI) Machine Learning Repository (link here), where it is currently hosted.

Two primary references support this development and demand special mention:

"Taming instabilities in power grid networks by decentralized control" (B. Schäfer, et al, The European Physical Journal, Special Topics, 2016, 225.3: 569-582), in which Dr. Schäfer (Network Dynamics, Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization - MPIDS, Göttingen, Germany) and his co-authors describe in detail the DSGC (Decentral Smart Grid Control) differential equation-based model to assess stability of smart grids;
"Towards Concise Models of Grid Stability" (V. Arzamasov, K. Böhm and P. Jochem, 2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids (SmartGridComm), Aalborg, 2018, pp. 1-6), in which Dr. Arzamasov and his co-authors explore how data-mining techniques can address DSGC model simplifications.
The author is particularly thankful for Dr. Arzamasov's personal guidance and comments on the overall dataset structure.
